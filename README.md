# Enrol-Course-Automated
python script to enrol in specific courses @ York University.
The script constantly uses VSB information about available seats, and if found, redirects to REM to enrol in the course.

The user receives an email upon successful enrolment in a course.

This project is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where the script runs 24/7 with the help of VM Instance.
