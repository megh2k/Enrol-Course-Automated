# Enrol-Course-Automated
python script to enrol in specific courses @ York University.
The script constantly uses VSB information about available seats, if found, redirects to REM to enrol in the course.

This project is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where the script is running 24/7 with the help of VM Instance.
